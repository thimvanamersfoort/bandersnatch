# Bandersnatch: The game :ghost:

Bandersnatch is an interactive story game, where you control your own story and ending. The story is based on the movie *Bandersnatch* on Netflix. :film_strip: 	

The game is heavily based on the film Bandersnatch (available on Netflix), and is created with the idea of having multiple paths in one story, each with a different ending. You control the game entirely using your mouse, so you won't need your keyboard (exept for filling in text ofcourse).

You have 3 main controls to control your story. You have 2 main buttons to make choices, and you have a smaller button to skip to the next scene. These buttons will appear and disappear when they're needed.

The game is build upon different scenes. If you're done with one scene (if you read everything, thought about your choices, etc.), you can click the small button(2 arrows) in the lower-right corner to enter the next scene of your story. The 2 buttons for making different choices will also take you to different scenes.

When you're in a dialogue scene, the text will be displayed using a typewriter effect (printed letter by letter). To skip this effect, click on any button used to skip gamestates (no pause button etc.), and the full text will display in the textbox. When all the text is displayed, the buttons can be used for their main purpose again.

A pause button is located in the upper-left corner of the screen. This will always be available, and here you will be able to look at your stats, enter different menus, change the sound settings, and just take a quick break from the game.

There are different easter eggs hidden in the game. These can be references to the original film Bandersnatch, other games and films, or just simple small jokes. We're not going to tell you where they are, so keep an eye out ;)

## The Story :scroll:
In Bandersnatch you play as an Agent. The Agent works for a secret service called The Agency and specializes in dealing with extreme threats.

This time, you control The Agent when he goes after the demon Pax. Pax is hiding in the dungeons of an old castle in Ukraine, and as his power slowly increases, he is seen to become more and more dangerous, and must be dealt with as soon as possible.

The Agency has already sent several other Agents into the dungeons of Pax, but there has yet to be someone who makes it out alive. Pax is known for being able to brainwash humans (and other creatures), causing an army of insane 'roamers' to roam through the infinitely large dungeons of Pax.

During your search you will encounter many of these 'roamers'. Some of them friendly, these will even try to help you, but some will also be extremely aggressive. Sometimes you will even meet another Agent, but friendly or not, no one can be trusted.

The dungeons you wander around in feel suspicious, and change you the more you stay in them. The deeper you go, the darker it gets, and the longer you stay in the dungeons, the more control Pax gains over you.

The creatures you encounter in the dungeons will give you choices, and the choices you make determine your journey. Are you going to fight or are you running away? Pax will do everything in his power to make you fail your goal, so stay alert when you're in there...

## Your choices :next_track_button:
Bandersnatch is based on making choices, which affect the story of the game and is done by the player. Every choice you make alters the story in one way or another. So if you finish the game one way, and you decide to retry with other choices, you'll see that the story will end in some other way. 

So every choice you make will be your own choice, that you personally made, right?

By creating the illusion of free will, we were able to make a game relatively small, yet so open and free, and still keeping players intrigued by giving them many different options. 

This is what gives the game its replay-value, and with over 30 minutes of fresh, new gameplay, you will always be able to just start over and choose an entirely different story.
